A very noisy loss implies that the learning rate might be too high, while a linearly decreasing loss would suggest that the learning rate may be too low. A large gap between training and validation accuracy would suggest overfitting due to large model without much regularization. No gap between training and validation accuracy would indicate low model capacity. \n",

    "- **Number of iterations**: You can gain an intuition for how many iterations to run by checking when the validation accuracy plateaus in your train/val accuracy graph.\n",
    "- **Initialization** Weight initialization is very important for neural networks. We used the initialization `W = np.random.randn(n) / sqrt(n)` where `n` is the input dimension for layer corresponding to `W`. We recommend you stick with the given initializations, but you may explore modifying these. Typical initialization practices: http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/#init\n",
    "- **Learning rate**: Generally from around 1e-4 to 1e-1 is a good range to explore according to our implementation.\n",
    "- **Learning rate decay**: We recommend a 0.95 decay to start.\n",
    "- **Hidden layer size**: You should explore up to around 120 units per layer. For three-layer network, we fixed the two hidden layers to be the same size when obtaining the target numbers. However, you may experiment with having different size hidden layers.\n",
    "- **Regularization coefficient**: We recommend trying values in the range 0 to 0.1. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "- After getting a sense of the parameters by trying a few values yourself, you will likely want to write a few for loops to traverse over a set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "- If you find that your train loss is decreasing, but your train and val accuracy start to decrease rather than increase, your model likely started minimizing the regularization term. To prevent this you will need to decrease the regularization coefficient. \n"
